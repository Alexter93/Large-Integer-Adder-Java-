# Large-Integer-Adder-Java-
A class project from my sophomore year of college that can add integers larger than the integer type's capacity using Java.
The trick is the same as the C++ variant, useing an array or a vector to hold each digit in an index and add the indexs of each. <br/>

## Instructions:
Simply enter an integer in the text boxes labeled “Number 1:” and “Number 2:” and click the “Add” button. The sum of the 2 numbers will appear in the textbox labeled “Result:” But if you only enter 1 integer, the other one will be treated as 0. An error message will appear if you click on the “Add” button without entering any integers. <br/>
